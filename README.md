This is the repo I'll be using to track my activities and progress on the Codédex site.


What is Codédex?
Codédex is a brand new way to learn to code online. Journey through the fantasy land of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Command Line, or Git & GitHub. Earn experience points (XP) to unlock new regions, & collect all the badges at your own pace.

    #30NitesOfCode is a habit-building Twitter / OPC challenge for those who want to commit to 30 consecutive days of learning to code. You start by choosing an virtual pet and it will be your companion for the journey.
    Inspired by #100DaysOfCode and Tamagotchi.
