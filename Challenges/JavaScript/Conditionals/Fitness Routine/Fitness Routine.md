ðŸ’ª Fitness Routine

Difficulty: Hard

Exercising and having a fitness routine is so important for our health and quality of life. These days, there are so many kinds of exercises that it can be a lil' intimidating to start.
Why don't we use conditionals and random numbers to help us pick an exercise and make it fun?

Create a randomNumber variable that generates a random number between 0 and 3.

Use a conditional statement to log one of the following:
0: "10 Push-ups"
1: "10 Sit-ups"
2: "10 Squats"
3: "10 Jumping Jacks"
When you're done, make sure to do the fitness challenge! ðŸ”¥

Hint
To generate a random number between 0 and 3:
Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);
Notice that it's 4 rather than 3. The random number is now 0, 1, 2, or 3.
