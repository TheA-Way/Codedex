ğŸŒŸ Michelin Stars

Difficulty: Easy

Many restaurants aspire to be awarded a [Michelin star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide) for their food. While getting the max 3 stars is extraordinary, even getting 1 star can change the fate of a restaurant.
There're only 153 restaurants with 3 stars in the world. ğŸ˜®

Let's create a system to award Michelin stars.

Define a rating variable as a number between 1 and 3, and log one of the following based on the number:
"ğŸŒŸ is worth walking to."
"ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ is worth driving to."
"ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ is worth flying to."
All other cases, log "Invalid."




Hint
For a refresher, to create an if/else if/else statement:
```js
    if (condition1) {
    // some code
    } else if (condition2) {
    // some code
    } else if (condition3) {
    // some code
    } else {
    // some code
    }
```
