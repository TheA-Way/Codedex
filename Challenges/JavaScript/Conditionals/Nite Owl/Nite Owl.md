🦉 Nite Owl

Difficulty: Easy

People tend to be either an [early bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_(person)) or a [night owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl). There are several factors that go into this, such as genetics, age, lifestyle, and more.

Let's use conditionals to see which one you are!

Start by creating a wakeUp variable and set it equal to the time you wake up, between 0 and 23.\
Test for early bird vs. night owl with an if/else statement:\
    &emsp;wakeUp is < 8, log "Early bird gets the worm! 🌅"\
    &emsp;Otherwise, log "But who wants the worm? 🌃"




Hint\
Less than 8 just means waking up before 8 am! 🍵

To set up a conditional statement, use if/else keywords:
```js
    if (condition) {
        // some code
    } else {
        // some code
    }
```

To log, or print, to the console:
```js
    console.log("some text");
```
