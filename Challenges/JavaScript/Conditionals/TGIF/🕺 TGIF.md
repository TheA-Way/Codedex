ðŸ•º TGIF

Difficulty: Medium

In many parts of the world, we look forward to Friday to kick off a weekend of leisure. Some express this with ["TGIF"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_God_It%27s_Friday) (short for "Thank God It's Friday").

Let's use conditionals to tell if the weekend is upon us!

First, define a day variable with a number between 1 and 7. So 1 represents Monday, 2 represents Tuesday, and so on.
Based on the value of a day variable, use conditionals to log one of the following:
If it's a weekday, log "Not Friday, yet!"
If it's Friday, log "TGIF ðŸ•º".
If it's a weekend, log "Yay, weekends! ðŸ™Œ".
Otherwise, log "Wait, what day is it?"
