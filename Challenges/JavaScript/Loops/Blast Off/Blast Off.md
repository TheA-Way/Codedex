ðŸš€ Blast Off

Difficulty: Easy

Since Apollo 11, rocket launches are moments of great excitement, especially the countdown.

Write a small program that uses a for loop to simulate a countdown from 10 to 0, logging each number to the console. Then, log "To infinity and beyond! ðŸš€" at the very end.

The output should look like this:
```html
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
To infinity and beyond! ðŸš€
```




Hint
Make sure the for loop ends at 0 (not at 1).
